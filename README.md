# Module One Final Project - MTA Status App

For our final project, we've built a Command Line database application to check status of MTA trains. 

Users are able to sign up/log in, check status of a train by train name or location

APIs used:
* MTA Real-Time Data Feeds (https://datamine.mta.info/)

## Install Instructions
